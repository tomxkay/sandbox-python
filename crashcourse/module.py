# storing functions into modules

# storing your functions in a separate file allows you to hide the details of
# your program's code and focus in a separate file allows you to hide the
# details of your program's code and focus on its higher-level logic

# code reuse
# code isolation for sharing

# a module is a file ending in .py

# importing an entire module
# import module_name
# module_name.function_name()

# importing specific functions
# from module_name import function_name
# from module_name iport function_0, function_1, function_2

# using as to give a function an alias
# from module_name import function_name as alias

# using as to give a module an alias
# import module_name as alias

# importing all functions in a module
